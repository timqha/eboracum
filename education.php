                    We are passionate about inspiring the next generation of musicians and launched BaRocks! in December 2015. It is
                    our aim to provide exciting and engaging education projects to involve as many children as possible across all
                    age groups and abilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The projects are led by the animateur for the ensemble, Max Bronstein and Director, Chris Parsons. They are
                    joined by both singers and instrumentalists depending on the nature of the project. We have delivered several
                    education workshops since the start of BaRocks, and have many in the pipeline.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our work with the Horrible Histories author, Terry Deary has also helped in broadening our audience to include
                    children. We have recently recorded a video with Terry called ‘The Glorious Georgians’ and this will form a
                    major part of a future education project we are working on taking UK wide.
